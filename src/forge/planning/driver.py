"""Mode P planning chain driver (TASK-MP-012).

The production driver that walks one planning run through the chain

    QUEUED → RUNNING → PRODUCT_OWNER dispatch → product_docs checkpoint
    (PAUSED) → approve/reject/defer/escalate/timeout → planned handoff
    (PLANNED_HANDOFF)

by consulting the pure planner (:func:`forge.planning.planner.plan_next_step`)
over history **translated from durable planning_run_events rows** — this is
what makes the driver re-entrant: after a crash, :meth:`PlanningRunDriver.drive`
resumes at exactly the step the durable history implies (post-merge review
finding: ``ExecuteHandoff`` was unreachable from durable history because
nothing wrote planner-shaped events).

Design notes
------------

* **Domain module, injected collaborators** — no NATS / SQLite / git types
  are imported here; ``cli/_serve_planning.py`` is the composition root.
* **Structured wait, not a poller** — escalation phase and remaining time
  are recomputed from the durable ``paused_at`` / ``escalated_at`` anchors
  on every loop iteration, so a daemon restart neither resets nor
  double-fires a window (rearm re-enters the same loop).
* **Arm-before-post** — re-publishes (rearm, escalation, defer rounds)
  happen only after the response waiter's subscription is armed. The one
  deliberate exception is the *initial* checkpoint publish (the tested
  ``checkpoint_product_docs`` contract owns pause+publish); the waiter
  arms milliseconds later and the escalation rounds are the self-healing
  backstop for a theoretically lost first response.
* **Task supervision** — the composition wraps ``drive`` tasks so an
  unhandled exception is logged loudly; a stalled run is recovered by the
  next boot's sweep/rearm (documented v1 limitation, exercised by
  TASK-MP-010 live validation).
